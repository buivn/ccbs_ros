# ccbs_ros
This repo is multi-robot motion planner framework which uses CCBS as a global planner to determine non-collision paths for all robots. The paths are sent to local planners which determine the path segment for robots to follow. The packages work on ROS and Gazebo. They contains: 
- *ccbs* (ROS package): the global motion planner - read the graph from a file, and received starts and goals of all robots, then determine robot's paths. 
- *cs685* (ROS package) - the local motion planner receive the paths from the ccbs package and send them to the each robot local planner (DWA). The action is used the monitor the robot movement.  
- *graph*: it is a python code to generate a graph from a occupancy-grid map (*graph_xml.py*). The file *display_graph_paths.py* helps us see the paths which are generated by CCBS. 

The packages are run on ROS noetic, ubuntu 20. We need to install [navigation stack package](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation).

To run the packages, we need to run on four terminals:
- *roslaunch cs685 cs685_robots_gazebo.launch*
- *roslaunch cs685 cs685_3turtlebot_navigation.launch*
- *roslaunch ccbs ccbs_main.launch*
- *roslaunch cs685 cs685_move_control_main.launch* 

The results are shown in the following videos:

There are some points needed to be improved:
- Improve CCBS paths: (more nodes for graph or another approach) 
- Improve the local motion planner (A robuster one than DWA)
