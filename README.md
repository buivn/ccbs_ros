# ccbs_ros
This repo is multi-robot motion planner framework which uses CCBS as a global planner to determine non-collision paths for all robots. The paths are sent to local planners which determine the path segment for robots to follow. The packages work on ROS and Gazebo. They contains: \
- ccbs (ROS package): the global motion planner - read the graph from a file, and received starts and goals of all robots, then determine robot's paths. \
- cs685 (ROS package) - the local motion planner receive the paths from the ccbs package and send them to the each robot local planner (DWA). The action is used the monitor the robot movement. \ 
- graph: it is a python code to generate a graph from a occupancy-grid map (graph_xml.py). The file display_graph_paths.py helps us see the paths which are generated by CCBS. \

THe packages are run on ROS noetic, ubuntu 20. We need to install navigation stack package. \

To run the packages, we need to run on four terminals: \
- roslaunch cs685 cs685_robots_gazebo.launch \
- roslaunch cs685 cs685_3turtlebot_navigation.launch \
- roslaunch ccbs ccbs_main.launch 
- roslaunch cs685 cs685_move_control_main.launch 

The results are shown in the following videos:

There are some points needed to be improved:\
- That CCBS paths: more nodes for graph or another approach? \
- A robust local motion planner than DWA? \
